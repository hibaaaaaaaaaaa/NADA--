## Background
The idea for this project came from childhood memories of the **Moroccan TV** show **Celestin**, where ‚ÄúCelestin‚Äù, a drop of water would teach viewers about the importance of water conservation.This led to the development of a VR application targeted at teens and kids, aimed at **raising awareness about water management**.

The traditional approaches, such as *posters or lectures*, have been used to raise awareness about water conservation but have not had the desired long-term impact on changing behavior. \
Some educational programs exist but often fail to engage younger audiences due to the lack of interactive elements that make the lessons more engaging. 


## How It Works
The **VR application** creates an immersive environment where users experience the consequences of water waste firsthand. Players navigate different scenarios, making choices that impact water conservation.

Key interactions include:
- **Daily Water Use Decisions:** Players decide whether to leave a faucet running or save water during daily tasks.
- **Environmental Impact Simulations:** Users experience the effects of excessive watering on plants, leading to water loss.
- **Guidance from Lilo:** The character **Lilo** provides real-time feedback and tips on water-saving habits.

## Features 

**1. Moroccan-Inspired Virtual Environment**

The app includes a **Moroccan-inspired virtual house**, featuring elements like mosaic Tiles from Fez. This familiar environment improves the immersive experience, making users feel more connected to the space.

The character is designed to be more **cartoon-based** to engage  both kids and teens.

**4. Integration of Moroccan Arabic(Darija)**

The VR application supports Darija, making it accessible for the target players . This helps them to easy understand and relate to the water-saving lessons.

## Tools 
- **Blender:** Used for modeling 3D objects like furniture, doors, and other environmental elements.
- **BlenderKit:** A plugin for Blender to quickly access and integrate ready-made models and assets into the project.
- **Unity:** Using Unity for creating the scenes.
- **C#**: Using C# to code interactions for water usage within the game.

## Environment
The VR application is set inside a Moroccan house. It consists of:
- Living Room ‚Äì The central gathering area.

- Kitchen ‚Äì A space where players interact with water usage while washing dishes.

- Toilet ‚Äì A scene focused on the impact of leaving the faucet running.
